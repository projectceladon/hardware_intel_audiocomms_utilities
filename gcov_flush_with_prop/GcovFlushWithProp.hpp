/** @mainpage Force the gcov flush manually
 *
 * @section why Why?
 *
 * Normally to enable a gcov code coverage on a component we just need:
 * - Compile with flags <tt>O0 -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</tt>
 * - Link with flags <tt>-fprofile-arcs -lgcov</tt>
 *
 * At the end of the component the coverage counter (.gcda) are written into
 * files by an automatic gcov flush.
 *
 * But for a system shared library, this is not enough. The automatic call of
 * the gcov flush is never done (like the destructor for a singleton) because
 * these libraries are never killed cleanly but kill by the OS.
 *
 * @section how How?
 *
 * @subsection install Installing lcov
 * If lcov is already installed on your system, please uninstall it, because
 * it's not compatible with the new Android gcc.
 *
 * Then download lcov here: http://ltp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ltp/utils/analysis/lcov/?view=tar&pathrev=MAIN
 *
 * Unpack the archive and install it:
 * @code make install PREFIX=/home/lab/tools/lcov @endcode
 * Then add @c /home/lab/tools/lcov/usr/bin to you @c $PATH variable in your
 * .bashrc file.
 *
 * @subsection before_compile Before compile your component
 *
 * - Link with this static library
 * - Force instantiation of this singleton by including this file at least one
 * instrumented source file.
 *
 * Example of Android.mk modification using this library and a compilation
 * switch:
 * @code
 * ifeq ($($(LOCAL_MODULE).gcov),true)
 *     LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(TARGET_OUT_HEADERS)/gcov_flush_with_prop
 *     LOCAL_CFLAGS += -O0 -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -include GcovFlushWithProp.h
 *     LOCAL_LDFLAGS += -fprofile-arcs -lgcov
 *     LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += gcov_flush_with_prop
 * endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection before_test Before the test
 *
 * @subsubsection environment Check special environment variable are sets
 *
 * In a shell run:
 * @code adb shell "echo $GCOV_PREFIX; echo $GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP" @endcode
 * Check the output is:
 * @code /data
 * 1 @endcode
 *
 * @subsubsection thread Check gcov flush thread is started
 *
 * In a new shell run: @code logcat | grep GcovFlushWithProp @endcode
 * Restart your instrumented component, to reset RAM coverage
 * Example for some Audio-Comms components:
 * @code
 * adb shell start media
 * adb shell stop media
 * @endcode
 * Check in the adb logcat the line below is displayed:
 * @code GcovFlushWithProp wait property "gcov.flush.force" is "true" !!!
 * @endcode
 *
 * Clean previous coverage:
 * @code adb shell "find / -name '*.gcda' -exec rm {} \;" @endcode
 *
 * @subsection test Make the test
 *
 * The instrumented component must not be restart during all tests.
 * Because all coverage counters are in RAM memory with the data of the
 * component. If the component restarts you lose a part of your coverage test.
 *
 * @subsection after_test End of the test
 *
 * @subsubsection gcov_flush Force the gcov flush
 *
 * Force a gcov flush by setting the property @c gcov.flush.force to @c true
 * @code adb shell setprop gcov.flush.force true @endcode
 * Check in the adb logcat lines below are displayed:
 * @code
 * GcovFlushWithProp __gcov_flush begin !!!
 * GcovFlushWithProp __gcov_flush end !!!
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsubsection gcov_copy Copy gcov counter
 *
 * Copy gcda file from mobile to Linux:
 * @code
 * adb shell "find /data -name '*.gcda'" | sed "s/\/data\([a-zA-Z0-9_\/\.\-]*\)/adb pull \/data\1 \/home\1/"
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsubsection generation Generate coverage
 *
 * @code
 * TEST_COMPONENT_GCDA_DIR=$ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT/obj/SHARED_LIBRARIES/<componentName>_intermediates
 * lcov --quiet --capture --gcov-tool $ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN/i686-linux-android-gcov --base-directory $ANDROID_BUILD_TOP --directory $TEST_COMPONENT_GCDA_DIR -output-file all.info
 * TEST_COMPONENT_SOURCE_FOLDER_FILTER="*?/<componentSourceFolderName>/?*"
 * lcov --quiet --extract all.info $TEST_COMPONENT_SOURCE_FOLDER_FILTER -output-file cov.info
 * genhtml cov.info -o whole_report
 * @endcode
